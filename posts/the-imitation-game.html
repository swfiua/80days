<p>The other day, Nick Hoskins posted a link to an intriguing puzzle, the
<a class="reference external" href="https://imitationgame.withgoogle.com/">Imitation Game Puzzle</a></p>
<p>I tried very hard not to click on the link.  There was a picture of
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a>, a puzzle and a competition.  Oh, and it was all run
by the <a class="reference external" href="https://google.com">Chocolate Factory</a>.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/">The Imitation Game</a> film has just been released, hence the timing of
the puzzle.</p>
<p>I clicked on the link.   Pictures of the bombe's that were used to
break Enigma in the Second World War.  Another picture of Alan Turing
and a little piece about the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Turing Test</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the premises of the puzzle was to prove you are not a
computer, in effect a reverse Turing Test.</p>
<p>I clicked on the link to download the pdf with the details of the
puzzle.  I was delighted to find what looked like a scan of a
type-written document.  This reminded me of working on puzzles with my
mum.</p>
<p>My mum loved crosswords.  Her favourite was to find a puzzle in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk">The
Guardian</a> compiled by <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Galbraith_Graham">Araucaria</a>.  I can still recall her telling
me how araucaria is the Latin name for tne <em>monkey puzzle</em> tree, with
a twinkle in her eye.</p>
<p>At holiday times Araucaria would often create a special, puzzle.  The
puzzles could keep you amused for days.   We would both take a look at
them, get a few clues, then give up in despair.  Mum would usually be
more persistent than me.   Maybe she would be cooking dinner and I
would be sat talking to her in the kitchen.  Happiness was solving a
clue together.</p>
<p>One thing I learnt from this is that talking to others about problems
helps you see them more clearly.  My mind works that way for sure.  It
doesn't matter if the person you are talking fully understands, so
long as they are engaged and interested it helps you find out what
assumptions you are making, it raises questions and you get a second
perspective on the problem.</p>
<p>Mum used to subscribe to special puzzles that Araucaria produced a few
times a year.   They would arrive in the post, printed on paper and
looked like they were copies of an original from a type-writer -- just
like the Imitation Game puzzle.   I was hooked.</p>
<p>Earlier this year I visited Bletchley Park with my wife and family.
The two boys are very interested in history and know way more than
anyone of their age normally does about the world wars.  Indeed, if a
Turing Test was done on either of them you might well conclude that
they are in fact computers since no human being could reasonably be
expected to know as much as they do.</p>
<p>The visit to Bletchley was a bit disappointing, our timing was bad as
they were just putting the finishing touches to some new exhibits so
parts of the museum were closed.  However, we did get to see the
re-constructed bombe working.   These bombe's were basically
electro-mechanical special purpose parallel computers.  They allowed
vast numbers of enigma settings to be tried as the initial part of an
attack on the Enigma ciphers.</p>
<p>The competition is still on-going, so I should not spoil the fun.
Suffice to say, the puzzle came at just the right time for me.</p>
<p>I have been going through a very difficult time, so to be able to get
away from everything for a few hours and immerse myself in the puzzle
was very therapeutic.</p>
<p>My poor wife had to put up with an entire weekend of bizarre questions
about a whole range of strange subjects.  She was an immense help as I
worked through the puzzle.  I was reminded of sitting round the
kitchen table with my mother, happy times indeed.</p>
<p>Araucaria would have been proud of this puzzle, many thanks to those
at Google that created the puzzle and helped me through this very
difficult time.</p>
