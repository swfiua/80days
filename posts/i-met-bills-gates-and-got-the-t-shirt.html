<p>Those who know me probably think that Bill Gates is not exactly on my
top ten list of people I would like to meet.</p>
<p>I've been an free and open software enthusiast for longer than I care
to remember.  Let's just say that over the years Bill hasn't exactly
been a friend of open source.  To be fair, it pretty much threatened
to destroy his rather lucrative business model.</p>
<p>To some extent it has.  Bill has moved on, so has Steve "linux is a
cancer" Balmer.  Microsoft is making more and more code available as
open source.  I would guess they have realised that if you want to be
relevant in today's software world you need your stuff to run on
linux, or at least play nicely with that platform.</p>
<p>There is a lot going on in the tech world, it isn't clear how it is
all going to pan out.  But free and open source is stronger than
ever.</p>
<p>Last night, my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Acegirl">ace-girl</a> and I wandered down the hill to the local
hostelry.</p>
<p>As I <a class="reference external" href="http://swfiua.github.io/80days/posts/the-music-from-uncle.html">blogged</a> a few weeks back, Saturday there is a DJ at this place
and it is often a fun night.  We were planning to meet another friend
who had just got back to the island.</p>
<p>We arrived and things were still quiet.  They were showing some
highlights from the FA Cup on the TV.  I love the FA Cup, always have
done.  It is when the lower league teams get a chance to show what
they can do against higher clubs.  Yesterday was a great day for the
underdogs.  Bradford City, also known as the <em>Bantams</em> (curiously,
google in their soccer info used the name <em>Bantams</em> rather than
Bradford City.  It was odd, because every other club was listed by
their more formal name.  It was Sheffield United, not the Blades
playing at Preston.</p>
<p>There were quite a few people having dinner at the place and 2-3 were
celebrating birthdays.  DJ Uncle was doing his round of the room,
figuring out his audience.</p>
<p>Around this time a guy walked by wearing a t-shirt and a silver tie,
all sparkles and glitter, obviously top quality as it was ready-tied
and held around his neck by a piece of elastic.   I saw the words,
"Bill's Gates" on his t-shirt.   My curiousity was peaked and we got
talking.</p>
<p>It soon became clear it was the guy's birthday.  He introduced himself
as Bill Gates (or it might have been Bill's Gates).  There may have
been some alcohol involved, so details are a little blurry.  But the
gist was he was founder member of "BFBC".  The F is along the same
lines as the f in swfiua.  So it was "Bill's F* Boat Club".</p>
<p>Clearly, this was my chance to be photographed with the man himself:</p>

kind enough to give me one of his t-shirts:</p>
<img alt="../galleries/Gates/i_got_the_t_shirt.jpg" src="../galleries/Gates/i_got_the_t_shirt.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 400px;"><p>Now in case you haven't heard Bermuda has been chosen as the venue for
the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.americascup.com/en/news/131_Bermuda-is-the-home-of-the-2017-America-s-Cup.html">2017 America's Cup</a>.  There is quite a bit of excitement about
the island due to this.  Maybe BFBC will enter the race :)</p>
<p>Of course, Uncle played <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inS9gAgSENE">Happy Birthday</a> for Bill and the others with
birthdays.</p>
<p>I have been on a bit of a Springsteen kick that last week or so,
something to do with starting to learn some tunes from my "Bruce
Springsteen easy guitar":</p>
<img alt="../galleries/Springsteen/Springsteen.jpg" src="../galleries/Springsteen/Springsteen.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 400px;"><p>Ace girl asked Uncle if he would play some.  And in light of the giant
killings in the FA Cup and with the hope of more to come from the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_United_F.C.">Red
and White Wizards</a> it was appropriate that he should choose <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vQpW9XRiyM">Glory Days</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks Bill and everyone who helped make last night a fun time.</p>
