A characteristic of so called democratic governments is they have some
sort of *Freedom of Information* system.

Citizens can make requests for information from their government.
There are usually costs associated with making these requests, the
governments argue that they have to cover their costs.

To be fair, with current systems, processing a request takes time.
Civil servants have to do searches, recover relevant documents and
then redact them as necessary to respect a whole range of privacy and
other concerns.

One problem is that these governments are not used to working as open
organisations.  This is in spite of the fact that much of what they do
could be done completely openly.  Further, it is being done on behalf
of their citizens.

In short, the default should be that government documents are
published for all the citizens to see.

This publishing would need to be:

* timely

* searchable

* free to download

It should be noted that the costs involved in making this data
available are negligible, once suitable infrastructure exists.  In
many cases, governments are starved of the resources to build systems
in order to make information available.  However, there are vibrant
free software projects that can assist with this, again mitigating the
costs.

If people creating documents are doing so in the knowledge that they
will be made public then that should deal with the redaction problem:
there will be nothing that needs redacting.

Regarding timeliness.  When contracts go out to tender the tendering
process involves commercial confidences that need to be respected
during the tendering process.  However, once a bid process is complete
there should be no issue releasing the all the documentation relating
to the bidding process.

Information security
====================

It is quite apparent today that it is not a question of *if*
information stored on a computer will leak, but *when* it will leak.

In this scenario, identifying the information that you are happy to
share can remove a significant burden on organisations.

If open becomes the *default* people can think more critically about
whether they really need all of what they are doing to be secret.

If there are sensitive pieces, these can be isolated and handled more
appropriately.
