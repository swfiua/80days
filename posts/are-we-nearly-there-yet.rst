As of last night I have competition entry all working.

You can see all the competions being run.  If a competition has not
started yet or is still in progress you can enter.

To enter, just give the nickname you want to use for the competion.

Next job is to add code to allow competitors to create and join teams.

This shouldn't take too long given what I now have.
