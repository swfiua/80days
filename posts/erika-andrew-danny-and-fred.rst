=============================
 Erika Andrew Danny and Fred
=============================
   
The last few weeks the Atlantic hurricane season has got more active.

Danny never really got started, was blown apart by sheer, but no doubt
spawned a lot of thunderstorms.

Flooding from Erika has resulted in numerous deaths in Domincan
Republic.

Erika has fallen apart, but again there will be a lot of thunderstorms
along its path.  There is a lot of moisture in the atmosphere.

Erika
=====

Early forecasts had the most likely track heading over Hispanola, Then
curving, but likely being blown apart by sheer from strong upper
atmosphere winds related to El Nino.

This is in fact very close to what actually has happened.

Track forecast
==============

The weather models started to suggest the storm would curve more
northerly.  This all involves really complex systems that stretch over
thousands of miles.

So the models most likely path was more northerly, and that might take
it on a path to hit Florida.

At one point the most likely track was heading all up the east coast
of Florida, without making landfall.  If it had held together it might
of intensified over hot water with low windsheer and been a major
storm at landfall in the Carolinas.

Throughout this period there was always the possibility of heading
over Hispanola, but it wasn't the most likely path.

Andrew
======

Andrew formed in a similar season to 2015 with a high El Nino.

It took a more northerly track, steered north of the Caribbean, then
turned straight into Florida.

I think a comparison of Andrew and Erika, Danny too, would be
interesting.

Fred
====

Hurricane names run on a six year cycle.  So, there are six lists,
that repeat every six years.

If a storm becomes significant in some way, usually the more intense
and damaging storms that hit land, the name gets *retired* from the
list and is forever associated with that storm.

So, we have Fred.  Now for me, Fred means Fiery Fred Trueman,
Yorkshire and England fast bolwer.  I never saw him play, but often
heard him commentating on test matches.

So some day we will see a Fiery Fred storm.

A storm named Fred has just formed.  Like Erika, there is a fair
amount of uncertainty on what path it takes and how intense it will
get.
