<p>This post is likely going to be a bit of a mixture.  It started out as
an account of what I am doing today, but I think it might turn into an
account of why a 3 day project can take 80 days and why that isn't
always a bad thing.</p>
<p>So I have had this goal for 80 days to create a website.  Now this
hasn't been my only goal in this period.  Actually, I have had a lot
of other stuff going on.  Oh, and there was Christmas and New Year and
of course the annual flu/cold/sore throat fun to deal with.  Also,
this is supposed to be a fun project and I have other fun things I
have been doing at the same time.</p>
<p>I have also been using it to learn some new stuff.  Now this is always
a dilemma with IT: learn to do things the <em>proper</em> way, learn about
the latest tools or just use what you already know?</p>
<p>I could have built this thing with pure django and simple html
templates in 2-3 days I am sure.  Well not quite that because I need
all these things too:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>authentication, user registration, preferably supporting third party
openID management.  That is where <a class="reference external" href="http://django-allauth.readthedocs.org/">django-allauth</a> comes in.</li>
<li>database migrations</li>
<li>deployment to cloud.  I think I will use <a class="reference external" href="https//koding.com">koding.com</a>
</li>
<li>code generation.  I wrote some simple code generators. I should be
able to include these in a <a class="reference external" href="https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">cookiecutter</a> so my next project will
be much quicker</li>
<li>I am learning <a class="reference external" href="https://angularjs.org/">angular.js</a>.  I already see the promise in this and
it should strengthen my javascript skills which will help with the
next phases of the project.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I have the ingredients together.  I think I know most of the
problems I will have, just have to put this thing together.</p>
<p>First thing: <cite>angular dates are in milliseconds</cite>.</p>
<p>Now with this knowledge I have the angular showing today's date,
80 days from now and 80 days ago.</p>
<p>Next stop is to get a form to register a team.  There is quite a bit
to learn here.  I will need to figure out how angular calls REST api's
and of course deal with the form stuff too.</p>
<p>OK, so thanks to <a class="reference external" href="http://campus.codeschool.com">codeschool</a> I now have a good idea of how most of
this angular stuff hangs together.</p>
<p>The next task is to see if I can get data from the django rest
services.  Before I do that I think it is time to re-organise the code
so that it can all be served by the django server.  I suspect this
might get tricky.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I should be in town in the morning, so I decided this would
be a good time to see if I can get this thing running on Gonzalo,
otherwise known as the <cite>laptop without an escape key</cite>.  This thing
also has a battery with a life of about 5 minutes.  But I like it in a
weird sort of way.  It needs more memory too, but that should be an
easy fix.  I think it might turn into that broom with 20 new heads and
five new handles.</p>
<p>Will be a good test of whether I can run everything on another machine
without too much pain.  With the screensaver doing the, "all work and
no play", I think it is time to take a break.</p>
